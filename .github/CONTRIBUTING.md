3. Add upstream remote: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/tplr-ai/basilica.git`
4. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.75.0 or higher
- Docker (for containerized execution)
- CUDA toolkit (for GPU support)

### Building

```bash
# Build all crates
cargo build

# Build specific crate
cargo build -p basilica-validator
cargo build -p basilica-miner
cargo build -p basilica-executor

# Build with release optimizations
cargo build --release
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests for specific crate
cargo test -p basilica-common

# Run tests with logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo test
```

## Code Standards

### Style Guidelines

- Follow Rust standard style guidelines
- Run `cargo fmt` before committing
- Run `cargo clippy` and fix all warnings
- Keep functions under 50 lines when possible
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt
